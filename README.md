Optimal energy management for solar-powered cars in settings of World Solar Challenge 2019
* Preprocessed race track to obtain sections of fixed length and by that reduce number of variables to optimize.
* Developed a physical model of the solar car to put constraints on optimization task.
* Using penalty method transformed constrained optimization task to unconstrained.
* Used L-BFGS to find optimal speed for each segment of track with energy consumption constraints.
